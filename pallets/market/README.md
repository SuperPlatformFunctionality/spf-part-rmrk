## Calls
- `buy(origin, collection_id, nft_id)`
- `list(origin, collection_id, nft_id, amount: T::Balance)`
- `unlist(origin, collection_id, nft_id)`
- `make_offer(origin, collection_id, nft_id, amount: BalanceOf<T>, expires: T::BlockNumber)`
- `withdraw_offer(origin, collection_id, nft_id)`

## Storages
```rust
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn listed_nfts)]
/// Stores listed NFTs info
pub type ListedNfts<T: Config> =
	StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, (CollectionId, NftId), ListingInfoOf<T>>;
```
